    <h2>Meet the Team</h2>
    <p>Life Support is composed of passionate software engineering students who share that passion for the environment.
      Through common problems of short battery life, we are united. We deliver clean and bug-free code to reliably
      charge your devices. Our members are involved in their community, often visible at protests and cleaning up the
      streets in their spare time. We strive to bring these technologies all around the globe.<p>
        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>Life Support helps to reduce battery waste and advocate for electrification worldwide in order to phase out
          the use of carbon-emitting fuels. That’s precisely why we offer our “Send your Gizmos” program to recycle
          these useful minerals that would have gone to waste otherwise.

          Life Support believes in the future. We are the biggest environmentalists in the electronics sphere.
          Recognizing that not only individuals but also companies must do their part to contribute towards fighting
          against climate change. That is our quest because right now, the planet needs is Life Support.</p>
        <h2>The Future of our technology<h2>
            <p>Life Support is a growth company, we seek to expand our software into many other electronics in the
              future. These will include Bluetooth speakers, battery packs, electric wheelchairs, smartwatches,
              consoles. Notably, we hope to work with partners in the electric vehicle industry to implement our
              technology into theirs. </p>
