Life Support Design
===================

Overall Look and Feel of Life Support
=====================================

Life Support is aiming to be an environmentally-friendly and modern company. As
a result, the website is following the popular art movement of minimalism. 2D
will be preferred over 3D for most components in the website, except for the
content of the images. The colour will be minimalistic by only selectively
using bright colours, and generally sticking to more neutral colours for
the majority of the website. This ensures that the user interacts with
the website in the most optimal way and focuses on the contents of the website.
