        <h2>Life Support Software</h2>
        <p>The Life Support software implements machine learning to automatically optimize your battery life based on the usage
        of your device. We offers the option of customizability for those who know what they want.
        <br>
        <br>
        Through recurrent neural networks, Life Support determines the apps that you don't use and prevents them from using your battery
        life. We can also pause wifi and data usage to save battery if deemed battery-draining. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Life Support also works while you’re charging. By testing billions of charging scenarios in simulations, our software found 
        the optimal rate of charging for all existing devices and charges based on that.
