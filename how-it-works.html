    <h1 style="color:White;">How Life Support can make your battery long-lasting</h1>

    <p style="color:White;">Life Support software allows you to make your battery long-lasting; you don't have
      to worry about unplugging your charger
      when the battery gets full cause Life-support software does the work itself.
      Many recent studies show that overcharging the battery when it has already hit 100% deteriorates it. With
      Life-support, that will be prevented because when the battery of your device hits the maximum healthy charge it
      stops the charger from accumulating
      power, and also keeps the battery in a good state resulting in more life and long-lasting battery.

      Life Support software implements machine learning to automatically optimize your battery life based on your usage
      of your device. It also offers the option of customizability for those who know what they want.

      Through recurrent neural networks, Life Support determines what apps you don’t use, and prevents them from using
      your battery life. It can also pause wifi and data usage to save battery if deemed battery-draining.

      Life Support also works while you’re charging. By testing billions of charging scenarios in simulations, Life
      Support has found the optimal rate of charging for all existing devices and charges based on that. Life Support
      also continuously updates it’s charging rates with the creation of new devices, that way you never have to worry
      about a new device.
