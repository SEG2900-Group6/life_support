      <h1 >How Life Support can make your battery long-lasting</h1>

      <p >Life Support charger/software allows you to make your battery long-lasting; you don't have
        to worry about unplugging your charger
        when the battery gets full cause Life-support charger/software does the work itself.
        From a research made, it shows that overcharging the battery when it has already hit 100% deteriorates it. With
        Life-support charger/software, that
        will be prevented cause when the battery of your device hits the maximum it stops the charger from accumulating
        power, also keeps the battery in a good state
        resulting in more life and long-lasting</p>

      <h2 >Life-support fast charging and supported devices</h2>

      <p >Life-support charger/software helps you charge your battery faster as it also keeps it in
        a good state.

        These are the devices it supports:
        - Android<br>
        - IOS<br>
        - Windows<br>
        - Mac<br>
        - Linux

<!-- <p2 class="products_software_text_paragraph">The Life Support software implements machine learning to automatically optimize your battery life based on the usage of the apps on your device. It also offers the option of customizability for those who know what they want. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Through recurrent neural networks, Life Support determines which apps you don’t use, and prevents them from killing your battery life. Life Support pauses your wifi and data usage to save battery if deemed battery-draining. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Life Support also works while you’re charging. By testing billions of charging scenarios in simulations, we have found the optimal charging rate for all existing devices and charges based on that. Life Support also continuously updates it’s charging rates with the creation of new devices, that way you never have to worry about a new device.
